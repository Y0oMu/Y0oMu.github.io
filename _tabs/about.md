Hi! üëã My name is **Jiayi Ye (Âè∂‰Ω≥‰∏Ä)**.

I am a final-year undergraduate student at the [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), actively seeking a PhD position for the Fall 2026 intake. üéì

My research interests lie at the exciting intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Large Language Models (LLMs)**. I am passionate about building interactive, personalized AI agents, with a special focus on applications within the ACGN (Animations, Comics, Games and Novels) space, such as role-playing agents and AI VTubers. I am also interested in Knowledge and Reasoning.

Currently, I am a research intern at the [MINE Lab](https://www.cse.nd.edu/mine/) at the University of Notre Dame, advised by [Prof. Xiangliang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BhRJe4wAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a maintainer for the [Open-LLM-VTuber](https://github.com/Open-LLM-VTuber/Open-LLM-VTuber) project, a popular open-source tool for creating LLM-driven virtual streamers.
