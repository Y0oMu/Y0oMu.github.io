Hi! 👋 My name is **Jiayi Ye (叶佳一)**.

I am a final-year undergraduate student at [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), actively seeking a **PhD position for the Fall 2026** intake. 🎓

My research lies at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, with a particular focus on applying technology to address broad socio-psychological needs. Globalization and social atomization have intensified widespread feelings of **loneliness and social isolation**, giving rise to a significant demand for emotional companionship. In response, my work is dedicated to designing and developing **next-generation conversational agents** to provide emotional support and accessible daily companionship for a broader population.

In this direction, I am especially interested in **AI-driven virtual live streaming (AI VTuber)** as a scalable intervention. As a highly interactive medium, live streaming holds the potential to deliver companionship at scale. It can serve a large number of users simultaneously through a one-to-many format, reducing individual social pressure while gathering like-minded viewers into an online community with a sense of belonging. I conducted a user study with viewers of AI VTubers to understand how they discover, bond with, and co-create around these virtual streamers. See our paper: [*My Favorite Streamer is an LLM*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10427). I am also a maintainer for the [Open-LLM-VTuber](https://github.com/Open-LLM-VTuber/Open-LLM-VTuber) project (4.5k+ ⭐), a popular open-source tool for creating LLM-driven virtual streamers.

Previously, I was a research intern at the [MINE Lab](https://minelab.nd.edu/) at the University of Notre Dame, advised by [Prof. Xiangliang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BhRJe4wAAAAJ&hl=en). I worked on **Trustworthy AI** and had a wonderful time there, contributing to projects like [*LLM Judge Bias*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02736) (ICLR 2025) and [TrustEval](https://trustgen.github.io/) (NAACL 2025 Demo).
