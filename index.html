<p>Hi! 👋 My name is <strong>Jiayi Ye (叶佳一)</strong>.</p>

<p>I am a final-year undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.scu.edu.cn/">Sichuan University</a>, actively seeking a <strong>PhD position for the Fall 2026</strong> intake. 🎓</p>

<p>My research lies at the intersection of <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> and <strong>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</strong>, with a particular focus on applying technology to address broad socio-psychological needs. Globalization and social atomization have intensified widespread feelings of <strong>loneliness and social isolation</strong>, giving rise to a significant demand for emotional companionship. In response, my work is dedicated to designing and developing <strong>next-generation conversational agents</strong> to provide emotional support and accessible daily companionship for a broader population.</p>

<p>In this direction, I am especially interested in <strong>AI-driven virtual live streaming (AI VTuber)</strong> as a scalable intervention. As a highly interactive medium, live streaming holds the potential to deliver companionship at scale. It can serve a large number of users simultaneously through a one-to-many format, reducing individual social pressure while gathering like-minded viewers into an online community with a sense of belonging. I conducted a user study with viewers of AI VTubers to understand how they discover, bond with, and co-create around these virtual streamers. See our paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10427"><em>My Favorite Streamer is an LLM</em></a>. I am also a maintainer for the <a href="https://github.com/Open-LLM-VTuber/Open-LLM-VTuber">Open-LLM-VTuber</a> project (4.5k+ ⭐), a popular open-source tool for creating LLM-driven virtual streamers.</p>

<p>Previously, I was a research intern at the <a href="https://minelab.nd.edu/">MINE Lab</a> at the University of Notre Dame, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BhRJe4wAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Xiangliang Zhang</a>. I worked on <strong>Trustworthy AI</strong> and had a wonderful time there, contributing to projects like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02736"><em>LLM Judge Bias</em></a> (ICLR 2025) and <a href="https://trustgen.github.io/">TrustEval</a> (NAACL 2025 Demo).</p>
