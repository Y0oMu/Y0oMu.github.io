Hi! 👋 My name is **Jiayi Ye (叶佳一)**.

I am a final-year undergraduate student at the [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), actively seeking a PhD position for the Fall 2026 intake. 🎓

My research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with a particular focus on applying technology to address broad socio-psychological needs. Globalization and social atomization have intensified widespread feelings of loneliness and social isolation, giving rise to a significant demand for emotional companionship. In response, my work is dedicated to designing and developing next-generation conversational agents to provide emotional support and accessible daily companionship for a broader population.

In this direction, I am especially interested in AI-driven virtual live streaming (AI VTuber) as a scalable intervention. As a highly interactive medium, live streaming holds the potential to deliver companionship at scale. It can serve a large number of users simultaneously through a one-to-many format, reducing individual social pressure while gathering like-minded viewers into an online community with a sense of belonging.

Currently, I am a research intern at the MINE Lab at the University of Notre Dame, advised by [Prof. Xiangliang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BhRJe4wAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a maintainer for the [Open-LLM-VTuber](https://github.com/Open-LLM-VTuber/Open-LLM-VTuber) project, a popular open-source tool for creating LLM-driven virtual streamers.
